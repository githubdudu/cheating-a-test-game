## Description
This game is a web-based single-player game developed using KAPLAY.js, which simulates students cheating in exams and trying not to get caught. The game mechanism is inspired by the childhood game shown in the TV show Squid Games, [Red Light, Green Light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_(game)).

  - The teacher cycles through three modes:
    1. **Looking away:** Safe to open the pencilcase.

    3. **Looking straight ahead:** Opening the pencilcase results in getting caught.
- **Win Condition:** Score above 80% and avoid being caught.
- **Lose Condition:** Get caught cheating or score below 80%.
